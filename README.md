developing new skills in the direction of my long term goals.

-Entry Point
-Application Layer
-Window Layer
-Renderer

Game Idea:
Basic scrolling 2D platformer.
As your progress, the platforms moves faster.
If you miss a jump, you die.
There are platforms both above and below you.
Gravity switches from regular to upside down and back again.
Will have either a double jump and/or dash. Maybe even a double dash.
Plays music in sync with the platforms. Must be funky, lol.
